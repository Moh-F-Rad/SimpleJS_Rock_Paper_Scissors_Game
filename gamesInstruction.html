			<h3>About Game</h3>
			<p>Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously 
			forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist),
			 "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended,
			 forming a V).</p> 
			 <p>A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw,
			 or a win for one player and a loss for the other.</p>

			<p>A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors
			 ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock");
			 a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
			 If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually
			 immediately replayed to break the tie.
			</p>
			
			<h3>How to play?</h3>

			CPU hand will show up against your choice. If you win, you get 1 point and 
			your score will be show up in the point box . The same thing happens for CPU if you lose!</p>
